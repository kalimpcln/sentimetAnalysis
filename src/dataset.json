    "review": "Be careful booking thru Priceline. I don't see any active hotel review link. Just spent the night in an absolute dump. Place should be condemned or at least not offered to the travelling public in Fort Lauderdale. No pool, no elevator, property looked smelled horrible, undesirables everywhere, no lobby just a drive up transaction window. Web pictures are all lies. You get the idea. Drive past and keep going. Oh and there seems to be no way to get in touch with Priceline to get a potential refund",

Never had an issue until today, to realize their customer service was terrible.\nI'm unable to speak to a supervisor, line drops and long wait line and still nothing.\nThey advertise the wrong location on their website and no one wants to take responsibility for their error.",

    "review": "I am a retired airline employee and love to travel but things these days change as did my plans.\nI had to put off my trip by one day in Nashville and Priceline refused to change my rental car reservation. The price was the same with their site for both days and there were plenty of cars available. Absolutely no flexibility, so I booked with Expedia and it was actually cheaper, and they have a change/cancellation policy. I can see why the overall rating with Priceline is so low.",
